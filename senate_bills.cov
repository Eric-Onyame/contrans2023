        1925, in Gallup, New Mexico.
            (2) A second generation Japanese American, Hershey Miyamura 
        first served in the United States Army near the end of World 
        War II.
            (3) Hershey Miyamura served in the Army at a time when many 
        of his fellow Japanese Americans, and that includes his future 
        wife, were detained in internment camps in the United States.
            (4) Hershey Miyamura served in the storied 442nd Infantry 
        Regiment, which was composed of soldiers with Japanese ancestry 
        and became one of the most decorated units in the history of 
        the United States military.
            (5) Following the start of the Korean War in 1950, the Army 
        recalled Hershey Miyamura, who had remained as a member of the 
        reserve components of the Army, back into active duty.
            (6) During an overnight firefight from April 24 to April

        severely wounded and captured as a prisoner of war.
            (8) Nearly 2\1/2\ years later, following his release and 
        return to the United States, President Eisenhower presented 
        Hershey Miyamura with the Congressional Medal of Honor in a 
        ceremony at the White House.
            (9) The lifelong dedication of Hershey Miyamura to the 
        United States never ceased. It continued long after his 
        decorated military service ended.
            (10) After he received his honorable discharge from the 
        Army, Hershey Miyamura opened a service station along Route 66 
        in his hometown of Gallup, New Mexico.
            (11) Hershey Miyamura remained active in his community 
        until his dying days, advocating for his fellow veterans and 
        inspiring young people with lectures on patriotism, faith, and 
        service.
    (b) Designation.--The clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
located at 2075 South NM Highway 602, Gallup, New Mexico, shall after

        1925, in Gallup, New Mexico.
            (2) A second generation Japanese American, Hershey Miyamura 
        first served in the United States Army near the end of World

            (3) Hershey Miyamura served in the Army at a time when many 
        of his fellow Japanese Americans, and that includes his future 
        wife, were detained in internment camps in the United States.
            (4) Hershey Miyamura served in the storied 442nd Infantry

            (5) Following the start of the Korean War in 1950, the Army 
        recalled Hershey Miyamura, who had remained as a member of the

            (8) Nearly 2\1/2\ years later, following his release and 
        return to the United States, President Eisenhower presented 
        Hershey Miyamura with the Congressional Medal of Honor in a 
        ceremony at the White House.
            (9) The lifelong dedication of Hershey Miyamura to the 
        United States never ceased. It continued long after his 
        decorated military service ended.
            (10) After he received his honorable discharge from the 
        Army, Hershey Miyamura opened a service station along Route 66 
        in his hometown of Gallup, New Mexico.
            (11) Hershey Miyamura remained active in his community 
        until his dying days, advocating for his fellow veterans and 
        inspiring young people with lectures on patriotism, faith, and 
        service.

        wife, were detained in internment camps in the United States.
            (4) Hershey Miyamura served in the storied 442nd Infantry

        ceremony at the White House.
            (9) The lifelong dedication of Hershey Miyamura to the 
        United States never ceased. It continued long after his 
        decorated military service ended.

        Army, Hershey Miyamura opened a service station along Route 66 
        in his hometown of Gallup, New Mexico.
            (11) Hershey Miyamura remained active in his community 
        until his dying days, advocating for his fellow veterans and 
        inspiring young people with lectures on patriotism, faith, and 
        service.

            (1) Hiroshi ``Hershey'' Miyamura was born on October 6, 
        1925, in Gallup, New Mexico.
            (2) A second generation Japanese American, Hershey Miyamura 
        first served in the United States Army near the end of World 
        War II.
            (3) Hershey Miyamura served in the Army at a time when many 
        of his fellow Japanese Americans, and that includes his future 
        wife, were detained in internment camps in the United States.
            (4) Hershey Miyamura served in the storied 442nd Infantry 
        Regiment, which was composed of soldiers with Japanese ancestry 
        and became one of the most decorated units in the history of

            (5) Following the start of the Korean War in 1950, the Army 
        recalled Hershey Miyamura, who had remained as a member of the 
        reserve components of the Army, back into active duty.
            (6) During an overnight firefight from April 24 to April

        severely wounded and captured as a prisoner of war.
            (8) Nearly 2\1/2\ years later, following his release and 
        return to the United States, President Eisenhower presented 
        Hershey Miyamura with the Congressional Medal of Honor in a 
        ceremony at the White House.
            (9) The lifelong dedication of Hershey Miyamura to the 
        United States never ceased. It continued long after his 
        decorated military service ended.
            (10) After he received his honorable discharge from the 
        Army, Hershey Miyamura opened a service station along Route 66 
        in his hometown of Gallup, New Mexico.
            (11) Hershey Miyamura remained active in his community 
        until his dying days, advocating for his fellow veterans and 
        inspiring young people with lectures on patriotism, faith, and 
        service.
    (b) Designation.--The clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
located at 2075 South NM Highway 602, Gallup, New Mexico, shall after

        Army, Hershey Miyamura opened a service station along Route 66 
        in his hometown of Gallup, New Mexico.

            (1) Hiroshi ``Hershey'' Miyamura was born on October 6, 
        1925, in Gallup, New Mexico.
            (2) A second generation Japanese American, Hershey Miyamura 
        first served in the United States Army near the end of World 
        War II.
            (3) Hershey Miyamura served in the Army at a time when many 
        of his fellow Japanese Americans, and that includes his future 
        wife, were detained in internment camps in the United States.
            (4) Hershey Miyamura served in the storied 442nd Infantry 
        Regiment, which was composed of soldiers with Japanese ancestry 
        and became one of the most decorated units in the history of 
        the United States military.
            (5) Following the start of the Korean War in 1950, the Army 
        recalled Hershey Miyamura, who had remained as a member of the 
        reserve components of the Army, back into active duty.
            (6) During an overnight firefight from April 24 to April

        severely wounded and captured as a prisoner of war.
            (8) Nearly 2\1/2\ years later, following his release and 
        return to the United States, President Eisenhower presented 
        Hershey Miyamura with the Congressional Medal of Honor in a 
        ceremony at the White House.
            (9) The lifelong dedication of Hershey Miyamura to the 
        United States never ceased. It continued long after his 
        decorated military service ended.
            (10) After he received his honorable discharge from the 
        Army, Hershey Miyamura opened a service station along Route 66 
        in his hometown of Gallup, New Mexico.
            (11) Hershey Miyamura remained active in his community 
        until his dying days, advocating for his fellow veterans and 
        inspiring young people with lectures on patriotism, faith, and 
        service.
    (b) Designation.--The clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
located at 2075 South NM Highway 602, Gallup, New Mexico, shall after

        United States never ceased. It continued long after his 
        decorated military service ended.

        Army, Hershey Miyamura opened a service station along Route 66 
        in his hometown of Gallup, New Mexico.

        inspiring young people with lectures on patriotism, faith, and 
        service.
